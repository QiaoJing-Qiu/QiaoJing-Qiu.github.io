I am a junior student at University of Hawaii at Manoa, who major in accounting. This is my fifth year in Hawaii, since I moved to this aloha island in 2016. Even though I did not major in MIS, I believe coding and other technology related skills are essential for now. Thus, I will try my best and work hard on this class.

As a foreign student, English is not my mother tongue. Instead, I am fluent in Cantonese and Mandarin because I born and raised in Guangdong, China. Sometimes I have a difficulty to explain myself clearly.

I did not know anything about coding before. This is an absolute new thing to me, but I am excited to learn about this.
