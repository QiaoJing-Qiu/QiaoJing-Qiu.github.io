My name is QiaoJing Qiu, who is an accounting student in Shidler College of Business. I born and raised in China and moved to Hawaii around five years ago. I can speak Cantonese and Mandarin, and still learning English for now. This is my third year at University of Hawaii.

I want to make MIS as my double major, that is one of the reasons why I took ITM 352. Since I think to learn about coding and programming, and understand how the software and computer work are very useful. Even though I want to be a certificated public accountant (CPA) in the future, to know about technology can help me learn about and use different applications efficiently. In addition, the one of the current trends for accounting students is to choose MIS as their double major or minor.
